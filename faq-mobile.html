  <h2>Q: Why Busgazer</h2>
  <p>A: Waiting for buses in painful, especially in extreme weather, e.g. the chilly winter in Pittsburgh. With Busgazer, you know exactly when you buses will arrives, so that you can plan accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>Q: Who are we?</h2>
  <p>A: Busgazer is originally developed as a side project by a group of students at the Computer Science Department at PITT. We made it available to the public to give back to the community. Our frist iOS App was released on November 8, 2014, at the beginning of the winter. And we released our first Android App on December 4, 2014. 
  </p>
  <p> Our mission now is to build a world class realtime transit App, and we start right here from Pittsburgh. If you like Busgazer and find it helpful, please share it with your friends and like us on Facebook. You can also support us via in-App purchase. Your support is our forward power!  </p>

  <h2>Q: How Busgazer works?</h2>
  <p>A: Busgazer predicts bus arrival times based on realtime data source provided by the the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAAC). The realtime predications are calculated from realtime GPS location data collected from tracking devices installed on buses. 
  </p>

  <h2>Q: How Accurate it is?</h2>
  <p>A: The accuracy of Busgazer mostly depends on the accuracy of the realtime data provided by PAAC. PAAC collects realtime bus location GPS data, and calculates the expected arrival time at each stop. Due to the unpredictable realtime road conditions (e.g. traffic lights, boarding time), do expect ~1 min variance when interpreting the predicted arrival time.</p>

  <h2>Q: What are the "Raw data from PAAC" and "Processed Data"?</h2>
  <p>A: "Raw data from PAAC" shows the original realtime data we get from PAAC. We then process the realtime data and combine it with schedule information, which is what "Processed Data" shows. All other transit Apps provide only one of the two kind of information, we provide both so that you can have a reference and get more accurate expected arrival time.</p>

  <h2>Q: Why are some buses shown as scheduled but not realtime?</h2>
  <p>A: Either because the scheduled bus is not on the road, or we failed to match the bus on road with the schedule information. In this case, you can check the "Raw Data from PAAC" to find out if any information is provided by PAAC.
  </p>

  <h2>Q: Why sometimes buses arrive are not shown on Busgazer?</h2>
  <p>A: We call them "Phantom buses". Mostly likely it is because PAAC failed to provide the realtime information about that bus. In this case, you can checkout "Raw Data from PAAC".
  </p>

  <h2>Q: What are coins used for?</h2>
  <p>A: 1) One coin is consumed each *active day* you use Busgazer. One day is active if you lookup bus stops. Coins are not consumed if you did not use our service.</p>

  <p>2) Coins can be used to unlock premium features.</p>

  <h2>Q: How to gain more coins?</h2>
  <p>Currently, you can get more coins by either refering friends or donation via "Support Us".</p>

  <h2>Q: What about the referral program?</h2>
  <p>A: You get 100 coins for each successful referral. By sending the referral link to your friends, you will get 50 coins if they installed and signed up Busgazer. You get the remaining 50 coins, if they successfully verifed their email address.</p>
    <p>As for now, Android user referrals are not rewarded automatically. However, you can send their screenshots to us, and we will adjust your coins accordingly if the referral is verified.</p>
